        <h1>My burnout journey</h1>
        <p>
          As a software developer, I've been on and off many projects over the
          years - different role on the same project, another project in the
          same company, and sometimes it's time to switch companies.
        </p>
        <p>It's a balance of what gives and takes my mental energy at work..</p>
        <ul class="plus-minus">
          <li>+ focus on real user problems</li>
          <li>- starting from a solution, finding a problem that fits</li>
          <li>+ clear steps forward</li>
          <li>+ defined-enough scope <i>before</i> implementation</li>
          <li>
            - multiple stakeholders who all need to review
            code/design/test/product fit and one of them doesn't have time, but
            comes back few days later to reopen an issue
          </li>
          <li>
            - merge conflicts between my own 6 PRs, because someone else renamed
            a folder and I modified files with multiple features that all wait
            for reviews
          </li>
          <li>+ quick review and merge, next iteration in next ticket</li>
          <li>+ boring technology that solves a problem</li>
          <li>+ new technology that solves a problem</li>
          <li>- new technology because someone was a hype junkie</li>
          <li>+ simple to start, infinite to master</li>
          <li>
            - learning cliff to start, then boring while impossible to remember
            random config
          </li>
          <li>
            - interviews with 5 rounds / whole-day project / recording myself
            how I explain my thinking into the void
          </li>
          <li>+ just hopping on a project with ex-colleagues / friends</li>
          <li>- back pain from long sitting</li>
          <li>+ daily walks</li>
          <li>- "almost" working tools</li>
          <li>- LLM chatbot "agents"</li>
          <li>+ community-driven events, conference volunteering, ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ..and about what I can do to keep the balance positive at a given
          environment. It's mostly about prevention, I have never collapsed from
          burnout yet, but many times, it's been less fun than I would have
          wanted.
