        It was at my grandma's where my story started to unfold. I realized that
        I was alone. Too alone. Not another living soul, anywhere. Just some
        luggage discarded in the backyard. And stuff which did not have any
        right to be in the backyard. Greyish stuff. Not entirely opaque. Better
        not looking up, I knew that the source of the light here was not a
        bright autumnal sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the stuff belonged to my past, the one I experienced a couple of
        years ago. More belonged to a more distant past, the one I could not
        remember, or, at the very least, I ought not to remember. And the rest
        were from another universe, from where my grandma might buy it once, or
        might have bought it already if the time had taken a different path.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, it wasn't my grandma's backyard I was used to. Not a
        universe I was used to. I <i>had</i> to test whether the laws of physics
        were different from the ones I knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, one door didn't have a handle. Pure provocation. Even though I
        wasn't able to slide through them like a ghost, I managed to open them
        somehow. And close them again, after I found behind them the usual,
        normal, bedroom as it always had been.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading back out across a glass patio, I noticed the affairs in the
        backyard returned to their more usual state. Quacking, clucking, and
        barking and in the middle of the commotion, my grandma. She hadn't
        noticed me though. I tried to get out, but an aggressive duck flew into
        me, a mother and a stepmother of a large flock of ducklings peacefully
        grazing all around the house. I was forced to retreat. Or was it two
        ducks? Yeah, definitely two mean ducks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the front door was not a viable option, I had to find a different
        way out. Sideway. I just stepped aside to think on it, not realizing
        there was supposed to be a wall of glass and bricks, barely aware of
        that fact. I was out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grandma's patio ends with a small staircase, so I ended quite a bit up
        above the ground. It was a time to experiment with flying...
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving the backyard behind, I went on to explore the tree tops behind a
        meadow. My eyes got caught by a beautiful arrangement of a young tree
        with colorful leaves, dry grass and huge green burdock leaves. I looked
        at it from all the sides and regretted that I forgot my camera. I told
        myself I would have to return later.
      </p>
      <p>
        After buzzing around the meadow, I returned to my beautiful arrangement.
        What a surprise, it was no longer there. It was just a normal piece of a
        meadow just like the rest. Time to move on, towards the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flying above the street, I haven't noticed I was losing altitude and
        that the houses along started to lose their shape, being replaced by
        something else entirely. I was startled to realize I was suddenly
        walking on a paved path. The greyish blue setts were layed out in a
        pattern that caught my attention, mesmerizing me to forget the surprise.
        As the road collected tributaries and sank into the ground, the walls
        were tiled in the same pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking in the majestic architecture of an anonymous city that I was
        leaving behind, I walked the length of the subterranean corridor and
        ended up at a crossroads. Stairway on the right, stairway on the left.
        After a short hesitation, I decided to go left. I knew where the stairs
        would lead. To the metro.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metro station was even more interesting than the maze of corridors.
        Entering, I could see the whole length of it. Orange brown tiles, but in
        the same mesmerizing pattern as before. To my right and behind, the rail
        tracks led into a dark tunnel. My end of the station was flooded with
        artificial light, the front of the station was bathing in daylight.
        However, the two sources of light somehow managed to harmonize into a
        tasteful play of glows and shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrary to the empty corridors, the station was full of people. Well,
        half full. A usual mix of anonymous folk, though slightly more
        cartoonish, less real than the other details. The details were all
        around, wherever my eyes rested. Lamps were full of history, nooks and
        crannies popped out from the background, smudges on the floor revealed
        stories. The billboards were detailed all over too, except where the ads
        would have been. Perhaps I just didn't want to see any ads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rail tracks were almost at the same level as the platform, just a
        step lower. And in between the tracks for both directions, there was a
        third pair of rails. A very unusual one, with a variable gauge. I could
        see with my own eyes how an entering train switched the the middle
        track. The wheels came closer together and further apart smoothly,
        without forcing the train to change speed. A slow speed, but
        nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the variable railway gauge remained unknown to me, the
        train returned to its original track and left into the tunnel. Whether
        it stopped or not to let people exit or enter, I couldn't remember.
        Maybe they did so while it was moving. In any case, people were crossing
        the tracks, to get to the other platform, all around the train. Not like
        any metro I knew, more like a tram, but not quite. I crossed to the
        other side too and not knowing what to do, I waited for my train.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had been interrupted from my waiting by a young man who threw a ball
        in my direction. An unusual ball that had an inner glow. Not
        monochromatic and not multiple colors at once. More like a shadow play
        on a single hue, while the hue changed secretly whenever I looked away.
      </p>
      <p>
        He'd always thrown it towards me, it would touch the ground, bounce in
        the original direction and then, unexpectedly, return to its owner. Like
        a boomerang that could bounce from surfaces. The ball radiated an
        impression of confidence, as if bouncing into impossible directions was
        a skill it learned when it was young and now it achieved an aura of
        elegance about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the heck, I asked myself. I didn't feel like playing catch,
        especially not with such a strange ball. Nevertheless, I couldn't avert
        my eyes from it. Thinking about it, thinking about the direction it
        moved, thinking about the direction I would like it to move, it started
        to listen to my thoughts as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus I started to play a game of catch. Sometimes throwing the ball with
        mostly my hands, other times reaching for it purely with my thoughts.
        Once, I managed to lose it to the tunnel, which was downhill by the way.
        Maybe that would have been the end and I could have happily returned to
        my train waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tall young man had other plans however, he saved the ball with a
        bout of willpower. The friend who joined him now might have had to help
        him or maybe not, they were now two to one. Luckily, a fellow traveller
        joined my side, turning the game into doubles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I started to enjoyed myself, the world started to blur on the edges,
        getting translucent and dark. I woke up for one last time to tell you my
        story. The story that would begin with a train arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        The train that would take me from this darkness to a world of daylight.
