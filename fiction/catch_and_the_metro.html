        I had been at my grandma's when things started to unfold. I realized
        that I was alone. Too alone. Not another living soul, anywhere. Just
        some luggage thrown about in the backyard. And other stuff which did not
        have any right to be in the backyard. Greyish stuff. Not entirely
        opaque. Better not looking up, I knew that the source of the light here
        was not exactly an autumnly sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the stuff belonged to my past, the one I experienced a couple of
        years ago. Others belonged to a more distant past, the one I could not
        remember, or, at the very least, I ought not remember. And the rest were
        from another world, from where my grandma might buy it once, or might
        have bought it already if the time were to take a different path.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, it wasn't my grandma's backyard that I was used to. Not a
        world I was used to. I <i>had</i> to test whether the laws of physics
        are the same I was used to, or not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, one door didn't have a handle. Pure provocation. Even though I
        wasn't able to slide through them like a ghost, I managed to open them
        somehow. And close them again after I found the usual, normal, bedroom
        behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading back out through a glass patio, I noticed the backyard on the
        other side returned to a more usual state. Quacking, clucking, and
        barking and in the middle of the commotion, my grandma. She hadn't
        noticed me though. I tried to get out, when an aggressive duck flew into
        me, a mother and stepmother of a large flock of ducklings peacefully
        grazing all around the house. I was forced to retreat. It was probably
        two ducks, yeah, definitely <i>two</i> mean ducks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front door not being a viable option, I had to get out differently.
        Sideways. I just stepped aside, not realizing there was supposed to be a
        wall of glass and bricks, barely aware of that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grandma's patio ends with a small staircase, so by stepping aside, I
        ended quite up a bit above the ground. It was a time to experiment with
        flying...
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving the backyard behind, I went to explore the tree tops behind a
        meadow. My eyes got caught by a beautiful composition of a young tree
        with colorful leaves, dry grass and huge butterbur leaves. I looked at
        it from all the sides and regretted that I didn't have a camera with me.
        I told myself I would have to return.
      </p>
      <p>
        After buzzing around the meadow, I returned to my beautiful composition.
        What a surprise it was that it was no longer there. It was just a normal
        piece of a meadow just like the rest. Time to move on, onto the street,
        towards the main road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flying above the street, I haven't noticed losing my altitude and tht
        the houses along started to lose their shape, to be replaced by
        something else entirely. I was startled to realize I was suddenly
        walking on a paved road. The greyish blue setts were layed out in a
        pattern that caught my attention, mesmerically forgetting the surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking in the majestic architecture of the anonymous city, I walked the
        length of the corridor and ended up at a crossroads. Staircase to the
        right, staircase to the left. After a short hesitation, I decided to go
        left. I knew where the stairs would lead. To the metro.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metro station was even more interesting than the maze of corridors.
        Entering, I could see the whole length of it. Orange brown tiles, but in
        the same mesmerizing pattern as before. To my right and behind, the
        rails ended in a dark tunnel. However, in the front, the front of the
        station ended in daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrary to the corridors, the station was full of people. Or perhaps
        only half full. A usual mix of anonymous folk, slightly more cartoonish,
        less real, than the other details. The details were all around, wherever
        I rested my eyes. Lamps full of history, nooks and crannies, smudges on
        the floor. The billboards were detailed all over too, except where the
        ads would have been. Perhaps I just didn't want to see the ads. My end
        of the station was flooded with artificial light and it somehow managed
        to harmonize with the daylight from the other end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rail tracks were almost at the same level as the platform, just a
        step lower. And in between the tracks for both directions, there was a
        third pair of rails. A very unusual one, with a variable gauge. I could
        see with my own eyes how an entering train switched the the middle
        track. The wheels came closer and further apart smoothly, without
        forcing the train to change speed. Slow speed, but nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the variable railway gauge remained unknown to me, the
        train returned to its original trail and left into the tunnel. Whether
        it stopped or not to let people in and out, I couldn't remember. Maybe
        they did so while it was moving. In any case, people were crossing the
        tracks, to get to the other platform, all around the train. Not like any
        metro I knew, more like a tram, but not quite. I crossed to the other
        side too and not knowing what to do, I waited for my train.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had been interrupted from my waiting by a young man, who threw a ball
        in my direction. An unusual ball that had an inner light. Neither
        monochromatic nor multiple colors in the light. More like a shadow play
        on a single hue, while the hue changed smoothly whenever I looked away.
      </p>
      <p>
        He'd always thrown it towards me, it touched the ground, bounced in the
        original direction and then, suddenly, returned to its owner. Like a
        boomerang that could bounce from a surface. The ball radiated an
        impression of confidence, as if bouncing into impossible directions was
        a skill it trained for when it was young and it now achieved an aura of
        elegance about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the heck, I asked myself. I didn't feel like playing catch,
        especially not with such a strange ball. Nevertheless, I couldn't avert
        my eyes from it. Thinking about it, thinking about the direction it
        moves, thinking about the direction I would like it to move, it started
        to listen to my thoughts too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus I started to play a game of catch. Sometimes throwing the ball with
        my hands, other times reaching for it with my thoughts. Once, I managed
        to lose it to the tunnel, which was downhill by the way. Maybe that
        would be the end and I could return to my train waiting in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tall young man had other plans for me however, he saved the ball
        with a bout of willpower. The friend who joined him now might have had
        to help him or maybe not, they were now two to one. Luckily a fellow
        traveller joined me as well, turning the game into doubles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I enjoyed myself, the world started to blur on the edges, getting
        translucent and dark. I woke up for the one last time to tell you my
        story. The story that would begin with a train arrival.
      </p>
      <p>The train that would take me from this darkness to daylight.</p>
