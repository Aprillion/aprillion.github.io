        As she turned on the central heating, she immediately started to warm
        up. Not that her teeth would stop chattering any time soon. You know
        like your brain stops feeling thirsty right after drinking? It takes a
        few minutes till the water gets from your mouth into your veins, but you
        wouldn't want to drink like a fish, now would you?
      </p>

        She was going to be late for the official dinner, again. Better to warn
        Kate to ward off the top brass for a bit, take a hot shower, and be on
        the way. Like, really, was it too much to ask to have the conference in
        Amalfi and not in Charlotte Pass when it was the middle of July? Who
        likes skying anyway!? Not Ada Musk.

        At least her talk went well a few hours ago, her team's "Multipath
        Adversarial Debate" approach seemed to catch the attention of everyone,
        not just the AI safety nerds like she dared to hope. Oh well, she
        prepared to pony up and talk to the investors, right? That was what she
        hoped for, that was why she left her favorite sweatpants safely in the
        attic that was her home office lately. A princess charming for the
        night, comparing her insights to Feynman diagrams over and over again.
        At least the metaphor was pretty solid, she spent countless hours to
        perfect all the examples with Zang. While the number of possible futures
        was infinite, the more ridiculous ones were always bound to be less
        probable, so they just needed to find a way to integrate all possible
        economic scenarios. And they were the first team to finally crack the
        problem. Two electrons sprawling an infinite zoo of virtual particles
        now looked simple in comparison to the new Clippy.

        Her infamous father's ghost finally decided to reside his primary
        consciousness on Mars, like his late body always wanted. And for the
        time, people found their love of real time conversations without
        6-minute delays, so the spotlight was hers. She was the focus point of
        the hottest topic since the HIV-V69 airborne pandemic. Imagine the poor
        scientist who named all the V6* serotypes 5 years ago, I bet ey didn't
        anticipate people will take it less seriously because of the meme
        potential ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Well, if poor Thomase used Clippy as eir teammate,
        ey could save some responsebot configuration. But ey didn't, so here she
        was in person, holopresence out of fashion between the lockdowns. It was
        her time to shine.

        And Ada shined that evening. She convinced the richest, the most
        progressive CEOs about the efficacy and the safety of Clippy. It did
        everything it was asked to do. It was the most ethical being you could
        ever talk to. And one year after the conference, it convinced all
        humans, bodies and ghosts alike, to die happily ever after.
