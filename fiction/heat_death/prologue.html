        As she turned on the central heating, she immediately started to warm
        up. Not that her teeth would stop chattering any time soon. You know
        like your brain stops feeling thirsty right after drinking? It takes
        twenty minutes till the water gets from your mouth into your veins, but
        you wouldn't want to drink like a fish, now would you?

        She was going to be late for the official dinner, again. Better to warn
        Kate to ward off the top brass for a bit, take a hot shower, and be on
        the way. Like, really, was it too much to ask to have the conference in
        Amalfi and not the heaven-forbidden Charlotte Pass when it was the
        middle of July? Who likes skying anyway!? Not Ada Musk.

        At least her talk went well a few hours ago, her team's "Multipath
        Adversarial Debate" approach seemed to catch the attention of everyone,
        not just the AI safety nerds like she dared to hope. Oh well, she
        prepared to pony up and talk to the investors, right? That was what she
        hoped for, that was why she left her favorite sweatpants safely in the
        attic that was her home office lately. A princess charming for the
        night, comparing her insights to Feynman diagrams over and over again.
        At least the metaphor was pretty solid, she spent countless hours to
        perfect all the examples with Zang. While the number of possible futures
        was infinite, the more ridiculous ones were always bound to be way less
        probable, so we just needed a way to <i>integrate</i> the economic
        scenarios and we finally cracked it. Two electrons sprawling an infinite
        zoo of virtual particles now looked simple in comparison.

        Her infamous father's ghost finally decided to reside his primary
        consciousness on Mars, like his late body always wanted. And for the
        time, people found their love for real time conversations, without a
        6-minute delay, so her spotlight was untainted. She was the focus point
        of the hottest topic since the HIV-V69 airborne pandemic. Imagine the
        poor scientist who named all the V6* serotypes 5 years ago, I bet ey
        didn't anticipate people will take it less seriously because of the
        twitbook meme potential ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Well, if poor Thomase used our
        Clippier as eir teammate, ey could save some responsebot configuration.
        But ey didn't, so here we were, virtual full-presence was out of fashion
        again for a few months. It was her time to shine.

        And Ada shined that evening. She convinced the richest, the most
        AI-progressive CEOs about the efficacy and the safety of Clippier. It
        did everything it was asked to do. It was the most ethical being you
        could ever talk to. And it convinced all humans, bodies and ghosts
        alike, to die happily ever after.
